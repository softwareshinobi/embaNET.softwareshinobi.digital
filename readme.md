## Overview

Embanet is a distributed, hybrid cloud infrastructure spanning the Americas and Europe. The core of Embanet consists of a collection of Linux servers hosted on the GTHost platform. These servers are named after Lamborghini models, such as Revuelto and Aventador.

## Hybrid Cloud Architecture

The Embanet hybrid cloud architecture leverages the capabilities of both public and private cloud environments. The public cloud component is provided by GTHost, while the private cloud component is comprised of the physical nodes within the embassy.

* **The Embassy:** My apartment physical location where I am connecting from.
* **GTHost:** The public cloud provider hosting the Embanet servers.
* **Linux Servers:** The computational resources within Embanet, named after Lamborghini models.

## Global Server Distribution

Embanet's strategic deployment across three continents aims to enhance performance, reduce latency, further special operations. The servers are distributed as follows:

### North America

* Purpose: Serves users and applications primarily located in North America.

* Benefits: Low latency for North American users, proximity to major data centers and cloud providers.

### South America

* Purpose: Serves users and applications primarily located in South America.

* Benefits: Low latency for South American users, proximity to local data centers and cloud providers.

### Europe

* Purpose: Serves users and applications primarily located in Europe.

* Benefits: Low latency for European users, compliance with European data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR).

## Connectivity and Network Infrastructure

* Public Network: Connectivity to the internet and the GTHost public cloud infrastructure.

* Private Intranet: A dedicated network connecting the physical nodes within the embassy.

* Secure Access: Virtual Private Network used to securely connect the embassy network to the GTHost cloud.
